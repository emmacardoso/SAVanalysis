#p value is 0.000167, indicating that there are statistically significant differences. F value is 7.072 indicating that the differences between the group means are substantial relative to the variation within each group. showing that the variability between group means is large compared to the variability within the groups.

#this shoes that there is a statistically signficiant difference between NEC and COPR, NPB and COPR, and NVBR and COPR, as all these have a p < 0.05, however, these three sites within NCOS dont have statistically significant variation betwen themselves. this is interesting because COPR has been restored for longer, and also if closer to the ocean
#also makes sense that the difference between NVBR and COPR are closer since the NVBR is the site closest to COPR

#results that are less than 0.05 show that there is a statistically significant relationship between the water quality variable and its effect on NDAVI even after accounting for/ taking into account all the other varaibles 

#do i need to check for multicollinearity ?


```

```{r}
#checking interaction effects 
#interaction effect occurs when the influence of one predictor on the dependent variable (NDAVI) changes depending on the value of another predictor. In this case, an interaction between water quality measurements and site means that the effect of these water quality parameters on NDAVI depends on the site 

# Interaction model
model_interaction <- lm(NDAVI ~ (DO.mg.L + DO.sat + Conductivity.uS.cm + Salinity.ppt + Temperature.C + pH) * site, data = SAVdata)

# Summary
summary(model_interaction)


#the reference site for these results in COPR
#this is showing how water quality changes at designated sites in relation to at COPR 

#p values over 0.05 mean that there is no statistically significant difference in how the water quality measurement affects NDAVI between the non-reference site and reference site.
